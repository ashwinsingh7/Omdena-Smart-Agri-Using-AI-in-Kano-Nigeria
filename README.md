## Project Overview

This project is part of the Omdena Kano Nigeria Chapter challenge, aimed at leveraging AI to improve agricultural sustainability and efficiency in Kano, Nigeria.


The project focuses on data collection, preprocessing, exploratory data analysis (EDA), and Data Science & ML driven insights to support precision farming and resource optimisation.



### Objective

To collect, clean, analyse, and extract meaningful insights from climate and agricultural data to help local farmers make informed decisions, thereby improving crop yield and resource management.



## Data Collection

Data was sourced from NASA's POWER Database. Extensive DAILY agroclimatology data was collected for 37 LGAs (Local Government Areas) spanning 12 metrics (including soil moisture, rainfall, humidity, wind speed and temperature) for 11 years from 2014-2024, totalling around 1.8 million data points.




## Data Processing and Analysis


1. Data Cleaning

Handling missing values, standardising formats and adding data on region, latitude, longitude etc.


2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

Understanding key agricultural patterns and trends.

Identifying correlations between factors like soil quality, rainfall, and crop yield.

Visualising variable patterns across 11 years and also averaging out for a single calenar year
